There is something youâ€™ll learn from this. You only need to be open to it.
All good
Go take a walk
"Failing is acceptable, quitting is not"
But you need to have your back first and foremost
You need to take a step back to see the forest for the trees
Positive change trumps level
Try to enjoy the things that have gone your way
You overcame a hurdle that most people would not be able
There is a lot to like about you and the more that you allow that feeling the more things you will find to like and then that light will really shine through people go towards that and the more that you like yourself the more that you will allow yourself to change the things that need changing
"No never. My non annoyance is un-ending. Even if I was annoyed, which I wasn't, the aggregations of interactions would be more important."
I think you conflate the end outcome with the process.
"What you have achieved with your tenure at pinterest as a contractor is remarkable and it is not because of me.Or maybe I have helped you tapped into some of that potential. You're the paragon of a learning agent. You took a scary project and tackle it head on and look for help anywhere and everywhere. If you want to code like, you'll achieve that and more. The only blocker in your path is the impression you have of yourself."
It'd be alright
Bahar I'll tell you a secret. I can see the future. You're going to do fantastic on Pinterest. But not immidiately. It will come when you truly respect yourself your time and effort.
"You can't give something if the cup you are pouring off has a hole, no matter how much water there is on it."
It's not good enough to hide the negative talk. I want it gone. Summarily fired.
The struggling is not the problem. The implication that struggling suggest that somehow you are the problem in your mind is the problem.
"Maybe we fix something, maybe we don't. We learn either way."
You can and will with enough time and the right attitued.
"This applies to everything. So you need to do something that vibes with you. But whatever that is, it's going to have places where it really sucks."
They key to not giving up is to be kind to yourself. It's not the fastest skier that won the gold medal. It's the faster one that didn't injure himself in the process.
"If you want to abondon do so, but crawling in a hole and die is a cop-out."
The only thing I did was to give you assurance that you are in fact a valuable member of society.
Find the courage in yourself to not take the cheapest shot of how useless you are. Like move on! It's boring. It's factually and demonstrably false. 
One day at a time
You should own up to the fact that you earned your spot on the tema. It wasn't a gift you had to claw more than anyone else. And you will get promoted to the level you deserve to be. 
Everyone wants to see you succeed. Don't forget. This is not adversarial. We are all a team. 
"Even if you couldn't do them now, you will in the future."
You don't wish. Wishing involves a visualization path towards achievement and you just say I can't do it. But you can if you wished. If you demanded the respoect for yourself that you gave on to others.
"You think I have helped you, but a big piece of it is that I defended you against worst outcomes. Imagine if you defended yourself, you could do it so much better than me. "
"You don't have the same skill set as others but you do have some strength they don't have. Your communication is better. You don't hesitate to ask to move the needle forward, you are a hustler of the highest caliber."
There is no back in the day. 
Thanks Bahar for being the rock(star) of the team. You were the OG reason people asked me to stay a year ago. 
"You say your memory is bad. So what do you want to do? If you don't have arms, would you just stay at the same place and do nothing? No, you'll learn how to do things diifferently. If your memory is bad, do a better job in documentation. "
